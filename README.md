Harris Lines Tool
======

The Harris lines tool has been developed in oder to semi-automatically detect and analyze Harris lines in digital X-ray images of tibiae of large populations. With the contribution of this tool, the authors intended to standardize the error-prone and observer-dependent manual Harris lines detection process. The main benefits from the tool are (a) the semi-automatic detection of Harris lines, (b) the digital measuring of the bones as well as the automated computation of the age-at-formation of each Harris line according to different methods / authors and (c) the generation of a table listing all analyzed data for direct statistical analysis (excel sheet). Furthermore, the reliability of the tool has been tested on radiographs of tibiae of a late Medieval Swiss population (Suter et al., 2008, and Papageorgopoulou et al., 2011).

## Installation Guidelines for the Harris Lines Tool 


### MatLab Standalone Application

The application runs as MatLab standalone application. This allows the user to run the tool without having installed a MatLab. No MatLab licence is needed. But there are some steps that need to be installed before running the Harris lines tool (You need administrator privileges). 

#### Steps for installation
- Install MCR libraries (MCRInstaller (exe, bin or dmg)
- perform the steps described in the [readme](install_readme.txt) file
- [[Download | download]] the Harris lines tool and double click on the executable of the application

For further help on installing and running a MatLab standalone application, visit the documentation website of MatLab: [[ http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/helpdesk.html| MatLab documentation]].


## Requirements

* MATLAB
* MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox

## User Guide

### Output of age-at-formation for the different methods:
The four different age-at-formation methods suggest and use different age categories for the final output. An overview is given here (for details see original publications):

* Maat, 1984: min-max age-at-formation: 0-18 (males), 0-16 (females) (steps between two age categories are smaller than 1 year, from the age-at-formation at the age of 1 year, there is an accuracy of 0.5 years per age-at-formation interval)

* Clarke, 1982: min-max age-at-formation: 0-16 (males+females) (steps between two age categories correspond continuously to 1 year)

* Byers, 1991: min-max age-at-formation: 1-17 (males), 1-16 (females) (steps between two age categories correspond continuously to 1 year)

* Hummert & van Gerven, 1985, only method for juveniles implemented: age-at-formation groups: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6-7, 8-9, 10-11, 12-13, 14-16, the output of the tool is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, respectively.




##Â Known Issues

### Further Improvement

* Manually add and remove Harris lines
* Import format: DICOM. Tiff ? others?
* Combining two lines on the screen
* Add field to choose pixel/cm conversion (currently it numpix / resolution * 2.54)


### Other problems
* Case that one individual has only one epiphyses? Age computation method?
* What if you only have half of a tibia. E.g. only distal or proximal part?
* Calculation of age for unsexed individuals (tables only for either males or females)

Note: this repository is not actively improved (nor supported), but the code is available such that it can be reused.
