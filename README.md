Harris Lines Tool
======

The Harris lines tool (http://harrislinestool.com/) has been developed in oder to semi-automatically detect and analyze Harris lines in digital X-ray images of tibiae of large populations. With the contribution of this tool, the authors intended to standardize the error-prone and observer-dependent manual Harris lines detection process. The main benefits from the tool are (a) the semi-automatic detection of Harris lines, (b) the digital measuring of the bones as well as the automated computation of the age-at-formation of each Harris line according to different methods / authors and (c) the generation of a table listing all analyzed data for direct statistical analysis (excel sheet). Furthermore, the reliability of the tool has been tested on radiographs of tibiae of a late Medieval Swiss population (Suter et al., 2008, and Papageorgopoulou et al., 2011).
